          <h4>2. Customer Service.</h4>

          <p class='indent'>The Company provides assistance and guidance through its customer care representatives. When 

          communicating with our customer care representatives (whether over the telephone, or via email or letter), 

          you agree to not be abusive, obscene, profane, offensive, sexist, threatening, harassing, racially offensive, 

          or to not otherwise behave inappropriately. Telephone calls between you and our customer care 

          representatives may be recorded for quality assurance purposes. If we feel that your behavior towards any 

          of our customer care representatives or other employees is at any time threatening or offensive, we reserve 

          the right to immediately terminate your membership and you will not be entitled to any refund of unused 

          subscription fees.</p> 

          <h4>3. Charges on Your Billing Account.</h4>

          <p class='indent'>a. The Company bills you through an online account (your "Billing Account") for use of the 

          Service. You agree to pay the Company all charges at the prices you agreed to for any use of 

          the Service by you or other persons (including your agents) using your Billing Account, and 

          you authorize the Company to charge your chosen payment provider (your "Payment 

          Method") for the Service. You agree to make payment using that selected Payment Method. 

          The Company may correct any billing errors or mistakes that it makes even if it has already 

          requested or received payment. This Section 12 includes any agreements you made with the 

          Company on the Application when becoming a Member or using the Service. The terms of 

          your payment will be based on your Payment Method and may be determined by 

          agreements between you and the financial institution, credit card issuer or other provider of 

          your chosen Payment Method. If you initiate a chargeback or otherwise reverse a payment 

          made with your Payment Method, the Company may in its discretion terminate your 

          account immediately. If the Company successfully disputes the reversal, and the reversed 

          funds are returned, you are not entitled to a refund or to have your account or subscription 

          reinstated. </p>

          <p class='indent'>b. You must provide current, complete and accurate information for your Billing Account. You 

          must promptly update all information to keep your Billing Account current, complete and 

          accurate (such as a change in billing address, card number or expiration date), and you must 

          promptly notify the Company if your Payment Method is canceled (including if you lose 

          your card or it is stolen), or if you become aware of a potential breach of security (such as an 

          unauthorized disclosure or use of your name or password). Changes to such information can 

          be made at "Account Settings" on the Application. If you fail to provide the Company any of 

          the foregoing information, you agree that you are responsible for fees accrued under your 

          Billing Account. In addition, you authorize us to obtain updated or replacement expiration 

          dates and card numbers for you credit or debit card as provided by your credit or debit card 

          issuer.</p> 

          <h4>13. Modifications to Service. </h4>

          <p class='indent'>The Company reserves the right at any time to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, the 

          Application or the Service (or any part thereof) with or without notice. You agree that the Company shall 

          not be liable to you or to any third party for any modification, suspension or discontinuance of the Service. 

          To protect the integrity of the Application or the Service, the Company reserves the right at any time in its 

          sole discretion to block users from certain IP addresses from accessing the Application or Service.</p> 

          <h4>14. Copyright Policy; Notice and Procedure for Making Claims of Copyright Infringement.</h4> 

            <p class='indent'>You may not post, distribute, or reproduce in any way any copyrighted material, trademarks, or other 

            proprietary information without obtaining the prior written consent of the owner of such proprietary rights.

           <li>a description of where the material that you claim is infringing is located on the Application (and such

            such as a url); </li> 

           <li>your address, telephone number and email address;</li>  

           <li>a written statement by you that you have a good faith belief that the disputed use is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and a statement by you, made under penalty of perjury, that the above information in your notice is accurate

          <p class='indent'>When you become a Member, you agree and consent to receive email messages from us. These emails may

          service announcements or changes, or emails containing commercial offers, promotions or special offers 

          from us or third party partners. Please see the Company’s Privacy Policy for more information regarding 

          these communications. From time to time, employees of the Company (or its parent or affiliated 

          companies) may create test profiles for the purpose of testing the functionality of our Service and 

          Application processes to improve service quality for our Members. Telephone calls between you and our 

          customer care representatives may be recorded for quality assurance purposes.</p> 

          <h4>16. Disclaimers.</h4> 

          <p class='indent'>a. You acknowledge and agree that neither the Company nor its affiliates and third party 

          partners are responsible for and shall not have any liability, directly or indirectly, for any 

          loss or damage, including personal injury or death, as a result of or alleged to be the result of 

          (i) any incorrect or inaccurate Content posted on the Application or provided in connection 

          with the Service, whether caused by Members or any of the equipment or programming 

          associated with or utilized in the Application or Service; (ii) the timeliness, deletion or 

          removal, incorrect delivery or failure to store any Content, communications or

          network or lines, computer online systems, servers or providers, computer equipment, 

          software, failure of email or players on account of technical problems or traffic congestion 

          on the Internet or at any Application or combination thereof, including injury or damage to 

          Members or to any other person's computer related to or resulting from participating or 

          downloading materials in connection with the Internet and/or in connection with the Service. 

          TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT ALLOWED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE COMPANY 

          PROVIDES THE APPLICATION AND THE SERVICE ON AN "AS IS" AND "AS 

          AVAILABLE" BASIS AND GRANTS NO WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, WHETHER 

          EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE WITH RESPECT TO THE 

          SERVICE OR THE APPLICATION (INCLUDING ALL CONTENT CONTAINED 

          THEREIN), INCLUDING (WITHOUT LIMITATION) ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES

          PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGEMENT. THE COMPANY DOES NOT 

          REPRESENT OR WARRANT THAT THE APPLICATION OR SERVICE WILL BE 

          UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR FREE, SECURE OR THAT ANY DEFECTS OR 

          ERRORS ON THE APPLICATION OR IN THE SERVICE WILL BE CORRECTED.</p> 

          <p class='indent'>b. ANY MATERIAL DOWNLOADED OR OTHERWISE OBTAINED THROUGH THE USE 

          OF THE SERVICE OR APPLICATION IS ACCESSED AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION 

          AND RISK, AND YOU WILL BE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR AND HEREBY WAIVE 

          ANY AND ALL CLAIMS AND CAUSES OF ACTION WITH RESPECT TO ANY 

          DAMAGE TO YOUR COMPUTER SYSTEM, INTERNET ACCESS, DOWNLOAD OR 

          DISPLAY DEVICE, OR LOSS OR CORRUPTION OF DATA THAT RESULTS OR MAY 

          RESULT FROM THE DOWNLOAD OF ANY SUCH MATERIAL. IF YOU DO NOT 

          ACCEPT THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY, YOU ARE NOT AUTHORIZED TO 

          DOWNLOAD OR OBTAIN ANY MATERIAL THROUGH THE SERVICE OR 

          APPLICATION.</p> 

          <p class='indent'>c. From time to time, the Company may make third party opinions, advice, statements, offers, 

          or other third party information or content available on the Application and/or through the 

          Service. All third party content is the responsibility of the respective authors thereof and 

          should not necessarily be relied upon. Such third party authors are solely responsible for 

          such content. THE COMPANY DOES NOT: (I) GUARANTEE THE ACCURACY, 

          COMPLETENESS, OR USEFULNESS OF ANY THIRD PARTY CONTENT ON THE 

          APPLICATION OR PROVIDED THROUGH THE SERVICE, OR (II) ADOPT,

          OF ANY OPINION, ADVICE, OR STATEMENT MADE BY ANY PARTY THAT 

          APPEARS ON THE APPLICATION OR SERVICE. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES 

          WILL THE COMPANY OR ITS AFFILIATES BE RESPONSIBLE OR LIABLE FOR 

          ANY LOSS OR DAMAGE RESULTING FROM YOUR RELIANCE ON INFORMATION 

          OR OTHER CONTENT POSTED ON THE APPLICATION OR SERVICE, OR

          reliance upon, any such content, information, statements, advertising, goods or services or other materials 

          available on or through any such Application or resource.</p> 

          <h4>18. Limitation on Liability.</h4> 

          <p class='indent'>TO THE FULLEST EXTENT ALLOWED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL THE 

          COMPANY, ITS AFFILIATES, BUSINESS PARTNERS, LICENSORS OR SERVICE 

          PROVIDERS BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY THIRD PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, 

          RELIANCE, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL OR PUNITIVE 

          DAMAGES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OR CORRUPTION 

          OF DATA OR PROGRAMS, SERVICE INTERRUPTIONS AND PROCUREMENT OF 

          SUBSTITUTE SERVICES, EVEN IF THE COMPANY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE 

          POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY 

          CONTAINED HEREIN, THE COMPANY'S LIABILITY TO YOU FOR ANY CAUSE 

          WHATSOEVER, AND REGARDLESS OF THE FORM OF THE ACTION, WILL AT ALL TIMES 

          BE LIMITED TO THE AMOUNT PAID, IF ANY, BY YOU TO THE COMPANY FOR THE 

          SERVICE DURING THE TERM OF MEMBERSHIP. YOU AGREE THAT REGARDLESS OF 

          ANY STATUTE OR LAW TO THE CONTRARY, ANY CLAIM OR CAUSE OF ACTION 

          ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO USE OF THE APPLICATION OR SERVICE OR THE 

          TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT MUST BE FILED WITHIN ONE YEAR AFTER SUCH CLAIM 

          OR CAUSE OF ACTION AROSE OR BE FOREVER BARRED.</p>

          <h4>19. Arbitration and Governing Law.</h4> 

          <p class='indent'>a. The exclusive means of resolving any dispute or claim arising out of or relating to this 

          Agreement (including any alleged breach thereof), the Service, or the Application shall be 

          BINDING ARBITRATION administered by the American Arbitration Association. The one 

          exception to the exclusivity of arbitration is that you have the right to bring an individual 

          claim against the Company in a small-claims court of competent jurisdiction. But whether 

          you choose arbitration or small-claims court, you may not under any circumstances 

          commence or maintain against the Company any class action, class arbitration, or other 

          representative action or proceeding.</p> 

          <p class='indent'>b. By using the Application or the Service in any manner, you agree to the above arbitration 

          agreement. In doing so, YOU GIVE UP YOUR RIGHT TO GO TO COURT to assert or 

          defend any claims between you and the Company (except for matters that may be taken to 

          small-claims court). YOU ALSO GIVE UP YOUR RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A 

          CLASS ACTION OR OTHER CLASS PROCEEDING. Your rights will be determined by a 

          NEUTRAL ARBITRATOR, NOT A JUDGE OR JURY. You are entitled to a fair hearing 

          before the arbitrator. The arbitrator can grant any relief that a court can, but you should 

          note that arbitration proceedings are usually simpler and more streamlined than trials and 

          other judicial proceedings. Decisions by the arbitrator are enforceable in court and may be 

          overturned by a court only for very limited reasons. </p>

          <p class='indent'>c. Any proceeding to enforce this arbitration agreement, including any proceeding to confirm, 

          modify, or vacate an arbitration award, may be commenced in any court of competent 

          jurisdiction. In the event that this arbitration agreement is for any reason held to be 

          unenforceable, any litigation against the Company (except for small-claims court actions) 

          may be commenced only in the federal or state courts for Johnson County, Iowa. You hereby 

          irrevocably consent to the jurisdiction of those courts for such purposes.</p> 

          <p class='indent'>d. This Agreement, and any dispute between you and the Company, shall be governed by the 

          laws of the state of Iowa without regard to principles of conflicts of law, provided that this 

          arbitration agreement shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act.</p> 

          <h4>20. Indemnity by You.</h4>

          <p class='indent'>You agree to indemnify and hold the Company, its subsidiaries, and affiliates, and its and their officers, 

          agents, partners and employees, harmless from any loss, liability, claim, or demand, including reasonable 

          attorney's fees, made by any third party due to or arising out of your breach of or failure to comply with this 

          Agreement (including any breach of your representations and warranties contained herein), any postings or 

          Content you post on the Application or as a result of the Service, and the violation of any law or regulation 

          by you. The Company reserves the right to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter 

          otherwise subject to indemnification by you, in which event you will fully cooperate with the Company in 

          connection therewith.</p> 

          <h4>21. Notice.</h4> 

          <p class='indent'>The Company may provide you with notices, including those regarding changes to this Agreement, using 

          any reasonable means now known or hereafter developed, including by email, regular mail, SMS, MMS, 

          text message or postings on the Application. Such notices may not be received if you violate this 

          Agreement by accessing the Service in an unauthorized manner. You agree that you are deemed to have 

          received any and all notices that would have been delivered had you accessed the Service in an authorized 

          manner.</p> 


          <h4>22. Entire Agreement; Other.</h4> 

          <p class='indent'>This Agreement, with the Privacy Policy and any specific guidelines or rules that are separately posted for 

          particular services or offers on the Application, contains the entire agreement between you and the 

          Company regarding the use of the Application and/or the Service. If any provision of this Agreement is 

          held invalid, the remainder of this Agreement shall continue in full force and effect. The failure of the 

          Company to exercise or enforce any right or provision of this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of 

          such right or provision. You agree that your online account is non-transferable and all of your rights to your 

          profile or contents within your account terminate upon your death. No agency, partnership, joint venture or 

          employment is created as a result of this Agreement and you may not make any representations or bind the 

          Company in any manner.</p> 

          <h4>23. Amendment.</h4> 

          <p class='indent'>This Agreement is subject to change by the Company at any time. If you are a Member at the time of any 

          change, the revised terms will be effective upon your use of the Service.</p>
